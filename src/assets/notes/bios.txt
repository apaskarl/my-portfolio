I'm a dedicated 20 year old programmer passionate about solving
complex problems through code. I thrive on innovation and constant
learning, and I'm excited to collaborate and contribute to the world
of technology. Let's create something amazing together!
       
Full Stack Developer with a side hustle of debugging late-night code
and pretending I know what I'm doing. I love creating smooth user
experiences and occasionally yelling at my computer when it crashes
(don't judge me, it happens).

I'm a Full Stack Developer who loves solving complex problems,
creating smooth user experiences, and occasionally Googling things I
should already know.

Code first, coffee later... Just kidding, coffee always comes first.
Full Stack Developer who's equally at home building databases as I am
Googling error messages I don't understand. Let's make the web a
better place, one bug at a time!

I turn complex problems into simple solutionsâ€”one line of code at a time
(and a lot of trial and error).
